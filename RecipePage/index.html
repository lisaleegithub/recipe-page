      <h1>Simple and Delicious Spicy Vodka Pasta Recipe</h1>
      <p class="description"> I usually buy jarred pasta sauce when I make pasta because I think it is tasty enough. One day, I saw this spicy vodka pasta recipe by a celebrity which went viral so I decided to try and it was quite good! The original recipe was great but I added more butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese for extra flavor. You can also shrimp, chicken, or ground beef for added protein :) </p>

          <li>Add pasta and the pasta water to the sauce.</li>

      <h1>Simple and Delicious Spicy Vodka Pasta Recipe</h1>
      <p>I usually buy jarred pasta sauce when I make pasta 
      because I think it is tasty enough.<br>
      One day, I saw this spicy vodka pasta recipe by a celebrity 
      which went viral so I decided to try and it was quite good!<br>
      The original recipe was great but I added more butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parmasean cheese for extra flavor.<br> 
      You can also shrimp, chicken, or ground beef for added protein :) </p>
